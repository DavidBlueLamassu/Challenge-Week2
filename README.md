# Web Design Portfolio (Challenge-Week 2)


# Description
The aim of this project was to create a web design portfolio which could be used as a platform to display my work in web design. It provides biographical information and contact details. The work section lists the names and images of my recent work and presents clickable links to the deployed webpages for more in-depth viewing.
